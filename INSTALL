Compilers that are needed:
--------------------------
(1) C++ (any recent version). We have tested with G++ v 4.6 and everything
works fine. This should be the case for most other modern compilers and
versions.

(2) Python (version 2.x). We have tested with Python v 2.7. Python bindings are
build when BUILD_PYTHON is set to "ON" (default:ON). If you don't need to build
Python, please set this to OFF (-DBUILD_PYTHON=OFF).

Tools:
-----
(1) In this project, we use CMake (minimum 2.8.2). CMake is supported on all 
modern operating systems. Please search the web for installation directions.

Libraries:
----------
(1) MPI: Any MPI-2 compliant implementation will work. Remmeber that wherever
you install MPI, please set the right paths (LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH on
linux), (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH on OSX) so that CMake will find your 
installation.

(2) LAPACK/BLAS: Any valid version of LAPACK and BLAS will do. If you are on
a linux system, you might be able to use "yum" or "apt-get" to install these
libraries for you. ATLAS is a good free library (google for it).

(3) Boost (minimum 1.49): We use only a few libraries from boost. Currently, 
this list includes ---
  --- mpi
  --- mpi_python
  --- serialization
  --- python
  --- random

To build these libraries, please follow these instructions:
(3.a) Download the latest version of Boost (should be 1.53). 
(3.b) Untar/Unzip everything in a directory (let's say 'boost-src').
(3.c) Go into 'boost-src' 
   #cd boost-src
(3.d) Boost strap the system by running bootstrap.sh script, which creates a 
      configuration file called 'project-config.jam'. Note that <INSTALL-HERE>
      should be replaced by the directory where you want to install boost!
   #/bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=python,random,mpi --prefix=<INSTALL-HERE>
(3.e) Add a line to 'project-config.jam' to ensure Boost.Mpi is built properly.
   #echo "using mpi ;" >> project-config.jam
(3.f) Install everything using the following command.
   #./b2 install
NOTE: As installation is proceeding, there are messages being spit out about 
the libraries that are being installed. Please pay close attention to any 
errors that might have occured.
(3.g) Make sure that environment variables are set properly.
    --- BOOST_ROOT: used by many programs to find the *base* directory of the 
    Boost installation. Set BOOST_ROOT to <INSTALL-HERE>.
    --- LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unix) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (OSX) along with PATH
    variable should be set to <INSTALL-HERE>/lib and <INSTALL-HERE>/bin.
    --- Boost.Mpi python bindings are present in <INSTALL-HERE>/lib under the
    name "mpi.so". To use Boost.Mpi, make sure your PYTHONPATH is appended
    with <INSTALL-HERE>/lib.

(4) Elemental (optional): Downloading and installing Elemental is simple. In 
fact, the dependencies of Elemental are similar to those of skylark. Elemental
depends on MPI, BLAS/LAPACK, and CMake. So, if you have followed all the steps
above, you're all set to install Elemental!

To build Elemental libraries, please follow these instructions:
(4.a) Download Elemental from google.code. 
(4.b) Untar/Unzip everything in a directory (let's say 'elemental-src').
(4.c) Create another directory for object files (let's say 'elemental-obj').
(4.d) Go into 'elemental-obj'
    #cd elemental-obj
(4.e) Configure your installation by invoking CMake.
    #cmake <path-to-elemental-src> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALL-HERE>
Remember, you can provide either the absolute or the relative path to 
'elemental-src' here.
(4.f) Build and install elemental:
    #make all install
NOTE: Once again, all the commands are run from 'elemental-obj', not 
'elemental-src'. If all went well, Elemental will have been installed in 
<INSTALL-HERE>/* directories. As usual, set your environment variables
correctly.

Elemental is currently optional in skylark, but it is turned ON by default. If
you don't want to use Elemental, you can turn it off by using the following 
flag --- "-DUSE_ELEMENTAL=OFF" when you are configuring skylark.

(5) At this point, you should have everything you need to install skylark. 
Installing skylark is similar to installing Elemental. So, the first thing
to do would separate 'skylark-obj' directory (assuming all your sources 
are in 'skylark-src' directory).
(5.a) Set the environment variables!
  --- BOOST_ROOT (if boost is not installed in a standard location)
  --- PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES (to install skylark's python bindings)
(5.b) Change to 'skylark-obj' directory.
  #cd 'skylark-obj'
(5.c) Figure out if you need python bindings. If so, please mention where you
want to install python library using the PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES envionment
variable. If PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES is '/home/pkambadu/Software/lib', skylark
python bindings are installed in 'home/pkambadu/Software/lib/skylark'
directory.  At this point, you will have to append PYTHONPATH with
'/home/pkambadu/Software/lib'
(5.d) Figure out if you want to use Elemental. If you don't, please turn off
USE_ELEMENTAL by setting "-DUSE_ELEMENTAL=OFF" during the CMake configuration 
process! USE_ELEMENTAL is turned on by default, so if you are building with 
Elemental support, make sure elemental is installed. If Elemental is not 
installed in a standard location, then make sure that the environment variable
ELEMENTAL_ROOT is set to the topdir where Elemental was installed.
(5.e) Configure
  #cmake <path-to-skylark-src> <options>
(5.f) Build everything and install the python bindings:
  #make all install
This will install python bindings in ${PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES}.
