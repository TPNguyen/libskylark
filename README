Skylark

This software stack provides sketching-based NLA kernels for more general
data analysis and optimization applications; such tasks have significantly
different input matrices and performance criteria than arise in the more
traditional scientific computing applications. The crucial NLA kernels to be
implemented include regression and low-rank approximations of matrices, akin
to the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
A Python interface allows to conveniently apply the kernels to be applied in
Python applications.


Please see INSTALL for required dependencies and compile/installation
instructions. Note that this software stack is currently under development,
some features are still experimental.
