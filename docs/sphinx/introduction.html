<h2>Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Matrix algorithms are the foundation for most methods in machine learning, data analysis, scientific
computing, and engineering applications. Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA) kernels are the key enabling
technology for implementing matrix algorithms across different computing platforms. Without highly
efficient and scalable NLA kernels, the challenge of big data cannot be met.</p>
<p>The goal of Libskylark (interchageably referred to as Skylark below) is to implement sketching-based
NLA kernels for distributed computing platforms, primarily with large-scale machine learning
applications in mind. Sketching reduces dimensionality through randomization, and is one of only a
few paradigms that have the potential to deliver a true boost in performance in the presence of
massive data, for an extensive class of applications. Sketching methods have been developed, for
over ten years now, mainly by the theoretical computer science community. Sketching techniques are
simple to implement, readily parallelizable, and often robust to matrix sparsity patterns and other
properties. Most of all, they have fast asymptotic time and space complexity. Applications in
population genetics, circuit testing, social network analysis, text classification, pattern matching
and other domains, have demonstrated the promise of sketching methods in practice.</p>
<p>Skylark is a software stack, being designed to be composed of distributed sketching-based NLA
kernels, for fundamental statistical and machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>The NLA kernels consist of matrix multiplication, regression, and low-rank approximation algorithms,
as well as acceleration methods for nonlinear modeling (i.e., kernelized regularized least squares,
multinomial logistic regression, robust regression and support vector machines), and statistical
dimensionality reduction techniques. The implementations are guided by error and sensitivity
analyses, to give users a high confidence assurance for the accuracy of the output of the software
stack. Sketching techniques, when used in a straight-forward fashion and on their own, can deliver
relatively crude, i.e. low accuracy results, since the work to achieve an error of <img class="math" src="_images/math/eaf4418fbe935c15a606516d8f55dc380cd8e822.png" alt="\epsilon"/>
can be proportional to <img class="math" src="_images/math/e979c0589d93fa6802636f6db4f3f645a247d310.png" alt="1/\epsilon^2"/>. Such crude results can be relevant in themselves: in
ranking applications where only an ordinal rank is required rather than the exact value (PageRank,
recommender systems); in situations where data noise dominates algorithmic error; or where the
tradeoff between speed and accuracy favors “quick and dirty” results that can be readily refined.
Also, in statistical and Machine Learning (ML) settings, approximate solutions can be regarded as a
formal mechanism to avoid overfitting, that is, a form of regularization.</p>
<p>However, sketching techniques can also be used to precondition standard methods, so that they
accelerate computations but do not suffer from loss of accuracy. Skylark will also provide sketching
techniques as preconditioners, or accelerators, to a large variety of NLA computations.</p>
<p>Another central goal of Skylark is to serve as a research platform with which to determine the best
sketching techniques in practice from among the many that have been proposed in the theoretical
literature. This is challenging, because many sketching techniques come with error bounds that are
asymptotic only, and contain unknown constants. Furthermore, a combination of criteria needs to
considered: error due to randomization, numerical robustness and accuracy, matrix access patterns
(rows, columns, submatrices), arithmetic operation count and communication requirements.</p>

<div class="section" id="sketching-and-sampling-methods">
<h2>Sketching and Sampling Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#sketching-and-sampling-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A wealth of techniques have been proposed in recent years for matrix problems, based
on random sampling of the input matrix via rows, columns, individual entries, or random linear
combinations of rows and columns. For brevity all these techniques will be collectively called
here sketching. Sketching yields “compressed” or “down-sized” versions of the input matrix,
that retain enough information to either yield approximate solutions, or to speed up methods
for finding high precision solutions, as discussed above.</p>
<p>In many situations we can represent the application of a sketching method to an n × d matrix A as a
product SA, where S has s x n rows. In general, accuracy or other sketch properties vary with s. For
some sketching approaches the matrix S is quite sparse, while in others it is highly structured, so
that computing SA involves an FFT or similar fast transform per row of SA, and not much more. When
each row of S has a single entry equal to one and all others zero, then SA represents a subset of
the rows of A. That is, S is a sampling matrix. Samples SA have very desirable properties: under
appropriate conditions, SA represents a collection of representative, “prototypical” rows of A,
which is useful in certain data analytics applications; and if A is sparse, then SA tends to be so
as well, at least heuristically.</p>
<p>By reducing dimensionality while still preserving structure, sketching can be used for approximately
solving a whole host of NLA problems, with substantial speedups in computation time. Other benefits
include reduced memory requirements, communication costs and IO overheads. This, in turn, offers the
potential to significantly improve the computational efficiency of solving higher-level statistical
modeling and machine learning tasks, by essentially replacing calls to traditional NLA kernels with
their sketching counterparts.</p>
<p>Skylark builds on distributed Numerical Linear Algebra libraries for Dense and Sparse Matrices, with
an MPI backend. Organizationally, it comprises of three layers. The core is a library of sketching
transforms whose main functionality is to enable a variety of input matrix types to be sketched,
using transforms specialized for various NLA kernels such as least squares (<img class="math" src="_images/math/1d69232050ab0ada641e7e2035f6e7c795795b65.png" alt="l_2"/>) regression,
robust regression (<img class="math" src="_images/math/6ee61fd6e8a1926a802b97fc99b66b8687d8f620.png" alt="l_1"/>) and low-rank matrix approximations. These kernels are being
implemented in the Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA) layer.</p>
<p>The accelerated NLA kernels are then used to accelerate higher level machine learning algorithms,
e.g., kernel-based nonlinear regression, matrix completion and statistical dimensionality reduction
techniques such as Principal Component Analysis. We also provide Python bindings to Skylark lower
layers to enable rapid prototyping of data analysis algorithms, and exploration of the sketching
design space for optimal performance in a given domain.  Input matrices can also be local numpy or
scipy arrays for single node execution of Skylark.  We use Python bindings for Elemental and
Combinatorial BLAS (through <a class="reference external" href="http://kdt.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">KDT</a>).</p>
<p>In the future, we also plan to support a streaming interface for out-of-core sketching and matrix
computations.</p>
<p>Note that some of the features mentioned above are under active development and/or currently being
benchmarked for performance improvements, and as such some of the features in the current stack should be
considered experimental.</p>
